<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>this project has two parts: - <a href="#server-side">Server side</a> - <a href="#client-side">Client (ui) side</a></p>
<h3 id="server-side">Server side</h3>
<p>On the server side, I used socket.io, Express and MongoDB. I used mongodb, I wanted the following to be a large amount of information that can be changed dynamically.</p>
