# Wallnotes

__Wallnotes__ is a project for sharing notes and thoughts by digital notes.

## Structure
this project has two parts:
- [Server side](#server-side)
- [Client (ui) side](#client-side)

### Server side
On the server side, I used socket.io, Express and MongoDB.
I used mongodb, I wanted the following to be a large amount of information that can be changed dynamically.

### Client side
On the client side, I used React.Js and tried to keep the components, elements and styles clear.
Client side can handle http requests and Socket.IO data.
